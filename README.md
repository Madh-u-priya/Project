RevShop P1: E-commerce Platform Development

In the first phase of the RevShop project, I developed a secure, user-friendly e-commerce platform for buyers and sellers. 
My responsibilities included implementing features like user registration, login, product browsing, cart management, and checkout. 
For sellers, I developed modules for inventory management, order tracking, and real-time product notifications. 
Using Java, Spring Boot, JSP, and MySQL, I built a modular backend and intuitive frontend that enabled effective user interaction. 
This phase honed my skills in full-stack development, database management, and creating scalable, user-centric applications.
